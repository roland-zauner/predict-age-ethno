# R scripts for ethnicity and age prediction

Purpose of this example code is to illustrate how ethnicity can be predicted based genotype data (R script: "**predict-ethno.R**"), specifically on ancestry informative single nucleotide positions (AISNPs) identified by Kidd and Seldin (see Pakstis *et al* 2019: <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-55175-x>) as well as using ethnicity-specific allel frequencies derived from the 1000 genome project (see: <https://www.internationalgenome.org/>). Further, script code (R script: "**predict-age.R**") is provided as an example on how to infer biological and phenological age (interpreted as lifespan) using algorithms developed by Horvath and colleagues (see Levine *et al* 2018: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5940111/>) from DNA methylation data generated by Illumina's EPIC array assays.

### Installation procedure
If you have git (see: <https://github.com/git-guides/install-git>)and docker installed on your local machine (see: <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>) you can perform the following steps:

1. Copy all files from git repo to your local machine
```
sudo git pull https://github.com/roland-zauner/predict-age-ethno
```
2. Build docker image containing R and respective libraries defined in the Dockerfile 
```
sudo docker build -t predict:latest .
```

### How to perform ethnicity prediction (Kidd and Seldin AISNP panel)

The following folder structure is assumed:
<br>![layout](folder-layout.png)

1. Provide genotype/SNP data in folder "input", an anonymized, randomized example file is provided  

2. Run R script **predict-ethno.R** in docker container with arguments "path to SNP data (.txt) and 1000 genome allele frequency data file (aisnp.1kg.RData)"
```
sudo docker run --rm -v /home/pro-env/input:/home/input -v /home/pro-env/output:/home/output pred-ethno:latest Rscript /home/scripts/predict-ethno.R /home/input/SNP-test-dataset.txt /home/scripts/aisnp.1kg.RData
```
3. Inspect prediction result in folder "output" (plain txt file)

### How to perform DNAm age prediction (Horvath SkinBlood and Horvath/Levine PhenoAge clocks)

1. Provide Illumina EPIC array raw data files (end with _Red.idat and _Grn.idat) in folder "input" 

2. Run R script **predict-age.R** in docker container with argument "path to input folder"
```
sudo docker run --rm -v /home/pro-env/input:/home/input -v /home/pro-env/output:/home/output predict:latest Rscript /home/scripts/predict-age.R /home/input/
```
3. Inspect prediction result in folder "output" (plain txt file)
